# How to run this code in different architectures

## Build PAMR/AMRD

To obtain PAMR/AMRD library, you need to contact William East 
(weast@perimeterinstitute.ca). Once you clone the repository,
follow the instruction that is suitable for your systme

### On Marylou

Working modules to build the library for Marylou are below
```
  1) gcc/6.4                 4) defaultenv/4(default)   7) hdf5/1.8.16_gnu-5.2.0
  2) gdb/8.1                 5) python/3/4
  3) openmpi/3.0_gcc-6       6) gsl/1.16
```

Once you have these modules, you need to configure it first via

`./configure --prefix=/home/<your username>/local`

Once you didn't see any problmes during configuration, then type
```
make install
```
If you build the library correctly, you should fine `libpamr.a`
and `libamrd.a` in your `/home/<your username>/local/lib` 
directory


### On Comet

Working modules to build the library for Comet are below
```
  1) gnutools/2.69         3) intelmpi/2016.3.210   5) mvapich2_ib/2.1
  2) intel/2016.3.210      4) gsl/2.1               6) hdf5/1.8.14
```
Once you have these modules, you need to configure it first via

`./configure --prefix=/home/<your username>/local --CC=mpicc`

We recommend to use mpicc as your c complier because somehow it complains
about cannot find `mpi.h` even you call mpi module

Once you didn't see any problmes during configuration, then type
```
make install
```
If you build the library correctly, you should fine `libpamr.a`
and `libamrd.a` in your `/home/<your username>/local/lib` 
directory

### On Mac

## Build the code

Once you build the PAMR/AMRD correct, you can simply build the code by
typing
```
make
```

In this directory, different `Makefile` is saved for users.

### On Marylou

Use Makefile.m7 then change to your user name and/or path

### On Comet

Use Makefile.comet then change to your user name and/or path

### On Mac

TODO : Need to figure out how we can work with Mac.

## Contact
Other architectures should work if you have similar/same modules as
above. If you have questions, please contact Hyun Lim (hylim1988@gmail.com)
