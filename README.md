`Notes` directory includes basic description about the project.

`ss_gr_hydro` directory includes spherically symmetric GR-Hydro
code that is origianlly written by Will East. To run this code,
user needs `PAMR` lib

Instruction to build/run this code is under 
[ss_gr_hydro/Instruction](https://github.com/hlim88/PBH-NS/tree/master/ss_gr_hydro/Instruction)

If you have any questions, please contact Hyun Lim (hylim1988@gmail.com)
